    <h1>Something Randow</h1>
    <p> There were wolves surrounding the man and he went super sayan... Then it was game over after
        needless to say... he won the fight. So the rest of the story goes on to be 
        really really really boring until the end. Then you get to put the book down
        and do something more enjoyable.
